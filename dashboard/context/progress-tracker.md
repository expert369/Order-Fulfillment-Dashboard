# Phase 1 — Project Foundation

**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Tasks

* [x] Confirm target Frappe app — `order_fulfillment_dashboard`
* [x] Confirm Frappe/ERPNext version — Frappe 15.103.1, ERPNext 15.103.1
* [x] Confirm module — `Order Fulfillment Dashboard`
* [x] Confirm dashboard page name — `/order_fulfillment` (www page)
* [x] Create project structure — `api/`, `services/order_fulfillment/`, `doctype/`
* [x] Review existing app conventions
* [x] Review required permissions

### Deliverables

* [x] Project structure ready
* [x] Development environment confirmed

### Notes

```text
APP STRUCTURE (adapted from build plan; target app is order_fulfillment_dashboard, not qgc_erp)

order_fulfillment_dashboard/
├── order_fulfillment_dashboard/
│   ├── api/                        <- backend API layer (Phase 4)
│   ├── services/order_fulfillment/ <- WooCommerce client (Phase 3)
│   ├── doctype/                    <- settings DocType (Phase 2)
│   ├── www/order_fulfillment.py    <- dashboard entry (Vite build)
│   └── public/order_fulfillment/   <- built dashboard assets
├── dashboard/                      <- Vite + React 19 + frappe-react-sdk
└── context/                        <- planning docs

KEY DEVIATIONS FROM ORIGINAL PLAN
- Target app is `order_fulfillment_dashboard` (dedicated app exists; build
  plan's `qgc_erp` structure was illustrative only).
- Dashboard is NOT a Frappe Desk Page: it is a standalone Vite/React app
  served from `www/order_fulfillment` at route /order_fulfillment.
- shadcn/ui is a design language to reproduce manually with Tailwind
  (architecture.md §35, §49), per library-docs.md.
- Tailwind CSS not yet installed — required before building UI (Phase 6+).
- CORRECTION (discovered in Phase 2): the nested package
  `order_fulfillment_dashboard/order_fulfillment_dashboard/order_fulfillment_dashboard/`
  was NOT a scaffold artifact — it is the **module folder** for module
  "Order Fulfillment Dashboard" (module folder = scrub(module name)).
  Frappe discovers doctypes under module folders (e.g. `chat/frappe_chat/doctype`).
  It was restored and all doctypes live under it:
  `<module folder>/doctype/`. `api/` and `services/` stay at app-package
  level (matches `chat/` app convention).
- `bench new-doctype` is NOT available on this bench version (5.29.1) —
  DocTypes are hand-authored and synced via `frappe.model.sync.sync_for()`.

PERMISSIONS (reviewed, applied in later phases)
- Configuration: Restrict `Order Fulfillment Settings` to System Manager (Phase 2).
- Dashboard: requires logged-in user; server-side WooCommerce calls only (Phase 4).
- Credentials: Password fields, never exposed to frontend (Phase 2/3).
```

---

# Phase 2 — Configuration

**Status:** ✅ Completed

### DocType

```text
Order Fulfillment Settings
```

### Tasks

* [x] Create Single DocType — `doctype/order_fulfillment_settings/`
* [x] Add WooCommerce URL — Data field
* [x] Add Consumer Key — Password field
* [x] Add Consumer Secret — Password field
* [x] Add API Path — Data field
* [x] Add Enabled field — Check field
* [x] Configure Password field — encrypted at rest, masked in API reads
* [x] Configure permissions — System Manager only (read/write/create)
* [x] Test saving settings — 9 unit tests pass (validation + security)

### Deliverables

* [x] Configuration page available
* [x] Credentials saved securely

### Notes

```text
VALIDATION (enforced when Enabled = 1, skipped when disabled)
- WooCommerce URL: required, must be http(s) with host
- API Path: required, must start with /
- Consumer Key / Secret: required

SECURITY
- Password fields stored encrypted (fernet), masked as ******* in reads
- get_password() is NOT whitelisted — credentials never reach the browser
- Permissions: only System Manager role on the DocType JSON

TESTS
- tests/test_order_fulfillment_settings.py — 9 tests, all passing
  (validation per field, invalid URLs, disabled integration allowed
   to be empty, encrypted storage, password round trip)
```

# Phase 3 — WooCommerce API Client

**Status:** ✅ Completed

### API

```text
https://cms-staging.buildmaster.ph/wp-json/qgc-erp/v1/order-fulfillment
```

### Tasks

* [x] Create WooCommerce client — `services/order_fulfillment/woo_client.py`
* [x] Load settings — `get_settings()` (disabled/partial config raise)
* [x] Implement authentication — HTTP Basic Auth (consumer key/secret)
* [x] Implement get_orders()
* [x] Implement get_order(order_id)
* [x] Test all orders endpoint — mocked (19 unit tests)
* [x] Test specific order endpoint — mocked
* [x] Implement timeout handling — 10s, mapped to ConnectionError
* [x] Implement HTTP error handling — 401/403 → AuthError, 4xx/5xx → APIError
* [x] Implement response validation — list / `orders` / `data` / `results` keys
* [x] Verify credentials aren't logged — credentials only in auth header, never in URL

### Deliverables

* [x] WooCommerce client working
* [x] All orders retrieval working
* [x] Specific order retrieval working

### Notes

```text
ERROR TAXONOMY (used by Phase 4/10 for friendly messages)
- IntegrationDisabledError      (integration turned off)
- IntegrationNotConfiguredError (incomplete settings)
- WooCommerceConnectionError    (network/timeout)
- WooCommerceAuthenticationError (401/403)
- WooCommerceAPIError           (other HTTP errors)
- WooCommerceInvalidResponseError (bad JSON / unexpected shape)

LIVE API PROBE (2026-08-10)
- Endpoint resolves, requires WooCommerce API credentials:
  HTTP 401 {"code":"rest_forbidden","message":"Invalid or missing
  WooCommerce API credentials."}
- Confirms Basic-Auth-style consumer key auth. Actual response
  structure still unconfirmed — needs real credentials (blocker).
```

---

# Phase 4 — Frappe Backend API

**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Tasks

* [x] Create backend API module — `api/order_fulfillment.py`
* [x] Implement get_orders()
* [x] Implement get_order(order_id)
* [x] Add whitelisted methods — `@frappe.whitelist()` (no `allow_guest`)
* [x] Add permission validation — guest session rejected with PermissionError
* [x] Normalize API response — `success/total/count/orders` + per-order `phases`
* [x] Handle exceptions — mapped to safe error structures, logged, never leaked
* [x] Test from browser/frontend — live HTTP smoke test on test.site (port 8011)

### Deliverables

* [x] Frontend can safely request order data
* [x] WooCommerce credentials remain server-side

### Notes

```text
WHITELISTED METHODS (frappe.call endpoints)
- get_orders()  -> {"success": true, "total": n, "count": n, "orders": [...]}
- get_order(id) -> {"success": true, "order": {...}} | {"order": null} if not found
- Both require a logged-in session; the framework rejects guests (403) and
  _check_permission() adds defense-in-depth.

NORMALIZED ORDER (per architecture.md §77; raw WC response never exposed)
- id, order_id, current_phase, created_at
- customer: null (placeholder — populated in Phase 5)
- phases: {enqueueing, picking, sorting, checking, loading}
  -> {start, end, elapsed} derived from *_start /*_end /*_elapsed

ERROR CONTRACT (architecture.md §82) — returned as JSON, not thrown:
- INTEGRATION_DISABLED / INTEGRATION_NOT_CONFIGURED
- WOOCOMMERCE_CONNECTION_ERROR   ("Unable to connect to WooCommerce...")
- WOOCOMMERCE_AUTHENTICATION_ERROR ("...check the integration settings.")
- WOOCOMMERCE_API_ERROR / WOOCOMMERCE_INVALID_RESPONSE
- INVALID_REQUEST (missing order_id)
- INTERNAL_ERROR (unexpected; logged via frappe.log_error, masked to client)

LIVE SMOKE TEST (2026-08-10, test.site via temp server on :8011)
- Guest call -> HTTP 403 PermissionError (framework whitelist gate)
- Admin + integration disabled -> INTEGRATION_DISABLED payload
- Admin + enabled w/ bogus creds -> real request to WooCommerce ->
  HTTP 401 -> WOOCOMMERCE_AUTHENTICATION_ERROR payload
- Password fields stay masked (*******) in API responses
- NOTE: dev server on :8000 only serves qgc_erp3.site (app NOT installed
  there); test.site must be served explicitly for dashboard dev/test.

TESTS
- tests/test_order_fulfillment_api.py — 19 tests, all passing
  (normalization incl. phase timing, empty/missing order, error mapping
   for all 6 taxonomy codes + unexpected, guest permission, masking)
- Suite total now 47 tests (was 28)
```

---

# Phase 5 — ERPNext Customer Mapping

**Status:** 🟢 Completed

### Tasks

* [x] Determine customer identifier from API
* [x] Determine ERPNext Customer mapping
* [x] Implement customer lookup
* [x] Add customer to normalized response
* [x] Handle missing customer
* [x] Test customer mapping

### Deliverables

* [x] Orders display ERPNext Customer

### Notes

```text
Customer mapping strategy:
- WooCommerce order_id maps to ERPNext Sales Order via custom fields:
  1. Primary: `custom_woo_job_order_id` (stores numeric order_id)
  2. Fallback: `custom_woo_job_order_no` (stores order number like JO#102)
- Lookup queries Sales Order, returns Customer (id + name)
- Batch lookup with chunking (500 IDs per query)
- Missing customer handled gracefully (returns null, order still displayed)
- Errors logged but never raised — customer failure cannot break order retrieval

FILES:
- services/order_fulfillment/customer_lookup.py
- api/order_fulfillment.py (integration)
- tests/test_customer_mapping.py (12 tests, all passing)
```

---

# Phase 6 — Dashboard Foundation

* [x] Dashboard is suitable for daily operations use

### Notes

```text
DESIGN TOKEN SYSTEM (architecture.md §44 fully implemented)
- Expanded @theme in src/index.css: surfaces, ink/typography, glass surfaces,
  brand/danger, per-phase accents, background glows, motion easings/durations.
- All Tailwind usage now routes through tokens. Removed raw color classes
  (white/x, purple-*, slate-*, red-*) and hardcoded inline hex.
- Custom easing: --ease-expo-out (cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)) used for
  transitions; hover transforms gated behind hover:pointer-fine:.

SIDEBAR
- Removed duplicated PhaseBadge inside filter items (icon+dot+label+count now).
- Active item: stronger glass + brand gradient overlay + brand-tinted icon well.
- Phases use color-coded accent dots instead of raw phase badge duplication.
- Press feedback (active:scale-[0.98]), focus-visible rings, idempotent close.

CARD
- Phase accent bar (3px, rounded) driven by CSS var per phase (getPhaseAccent).
- Hierarchy: "Order" label + mono order ID; customer section; created + age row.
- Hover: -translate-y-0.5 + stronger border/background, hover:pointer-fine gated.
- Entrance: animate-card-in with 40ms stagger (capped at 12) via style delay.

PHASE INDICATORS
- PhaseBadge now includes a phase-colored dot; sizes sm/md/lg preserved.
- getPhaseColor/getPhaseAccent map to token utilities / CSS vars.

RESPONSIVE
- Sidebar hidden below lg; mobile slide-over drawer with backdrop + Escape
  close, inert when closed, auto-close on filter select.
- Header stacks on mobile; hamburger button (lg:hidden); controls wrap.

HEADER / CONTROLS
- Auto Refresh checkbox replaced with an accessible switch (role="switch").
- Added full-screen toggle (Fullscreen API + error fallback).
- Refresh/primary buttons: press feedback + brand tokens; shadow-brand/30.
- Last updated now shows HH:MM:SS (formatTime) per spec.

STATES
- LoadingSkeleton mirrors new card layout (accent bar, shimmer, stagger).
- EmptyState: glass icon tile + contextual phase message + refresh CTA.
- ErrorState: danger-soft glass panel, icon tile, Try Again / Dismiss.
- Refresh with existing data no longer unmounts the grid (opacity 40 dim
  during refetch instead of flicker) — fixes pre-existing auto-refresh jump.

VERIFICATION
- oxlint clean, tsc clean (src), vite build succeeds; built CSS confirms
  token utilities emitted (ease-expo-out, phase colors, glass surfaces,
  pointer-fine hover, xl:grid-cols-6, card-in keyframes).
```

* [x] Integrated into `get_orders()` and `get_order()` API endpoints
* [x] 12 unit tests passing (test_customer_mapping.py)

---

## 2026-08-10 — Phase 4 (Frappe Backend API)

### Completed

* [x] `api/order_fulfillment.py`: whitelisted get_orders() + get_order(id)
* [x] Guest rejection (framework 403 + explicit session check)
* [x] Normalized response contract (§77) with per-phase start/end/elapsed
* [x] Error taxonomy mapped to safe JSON contract (§82), masked + logged
* [x] Live HTTP smoke test on test.site (disabled + bogus-credential paths)
* [x] 19 new unit tests; suite at 47 total
* [x] ruff clean

### Next

* [ ] Inspect actual WooCommerce API response (needs real credentials)
* [ ] Implement ERPNext customer lookup (Phase 5)
* [ ] Build dashboard frontend (Phase 6+)

---

## 2026-08-10 — Phase 6 (Dashboard Foundation)

### Completed

* [x] Tailwind CSS v4 installed with design tokens (architecture.md §44)
* [x] Zustand store for dashboard state (architecture.md §53)
* [x] Glassmorphism UI components: GlassPanel, GlassCard, PhaseBadge
* [x] Dashboard layout: Sidebar (~20%), Header, Main Content (~80%)
* [x] Responsive 6-column order card grid (xl:6, lg:4, sm:2, base:1)
* [x] OrderCard with Order ID, PhaseBadge, Customer, Created At
* [x] Phase filtering in Sidebar with order counts
* [x] Manual refresh button with loading state
* [x] Auto-refresh (30s polling) preserving active filter
* [x] Last updated timestamp display
* [x] LoadingSkeleton, EmptyState, ErrorState components
* [x] Error handling with user-friendly messages per backend error taxonomy
* [x] Build successful, lint clean
* [x] Assets served via www/order_fulfillment at /order_fulfillment
* [x] Fixed React 19 incompatibility with frappe-react-sdk — downgraded to React 18.3.1

---

## 2026-08-11 — Phase 11 (UI/UX Improvements)

### Completed

* [x] Expanded design tokens in index.css (@theme) — surfaces, ink, glass, phases, glows, motion
* [x] Routed all styling through tokens (removed raw color classes + hardcoded hex)
* [x] Sidebar polish: active gradient overlay, accent dots, press/focus states, removed badge duplication
* [x] Card polish: phase accent bar, hierarchy, hover lift (pointer-fine), entrance stagger
* [x] PhaseBadge: phase-colored dot indicator
* [x] Custom easing + duration tokens; reduced hover animations
* [x] Mobile responsive: sidebar slide-over drawer (lg-hidden), Escape close, inert when closed
* [x] Full-screen toggle + accessible auto-refresh switch in header
* [x] LoadingSkeleton / EmptyState / ErrorState redesigned to new card layout
* [x] Fixed refresh flicker — grid stays mounted (dimmed) during refetch
* [x] Verified: 6-column desktop grid, token utilities emitted in build output
* [x] oxlint clean, tsc clean (src), vite build + copy-html-entry OK
